## Distributions of Fantasy Hockey GMs picks

Small program to illustrate the distribution of GMs picks for the upcoming draft in our personal fantasy league.
GMs from last year made plenty of trades for picks and some are going to be much more fortunate than others.  

This project uses the ChartNew.js library found at : https://github.com/FVANCOP/ChartNew.js/
Linke to website showcasing distributions:
